        The movie takes us into the life of Ian (Iqbaal Ramadhan), an eldest son who bears great responsibility as the backbone of the family. While his peers are busy chasing their dreams, Ian struggles to meet the heavy expectations of his parents. This pressure has strained his relationship with his parents and younger brother, Uta. He was always compared to Uta, who seemed to be living the life the family wanted. However, things take a drastic turn when tragedy strikes. Ian and Uta lost their parents, forcing them to survive in the midst of adversity. The increasing burden of responsibility made Ian slowly lose himself. He suppresses all emotions, until he can no longer feel happiness or sadness, a condition that is depicted very heartbreakingly in this movie.

      In terms of visuals, this movie successfully presents an atmosphere that fits the story. The well-crafted cinematography is able to strengthen the dark and stressful nuances experienced by Ian. The use of dim lighting and intimate framing makes us really feel the loneliness experienced by the main character. Not only that, the acting of the players is also one of the main strengths of this film. Iqbaal Ramadhan’s acting as the main portrait of Ian is his emotions are raw and honest, allowing the audience to feel his pain. Support from other actors such as Jordi Onsu, Yasamin Jasem, and Dwi Sasono further enriches the dynamics of the story, presenting a relationship between characters that feels so real and honest.

      In addition to the stunning visuals and acting, the audience’s emotions in this movie are greatly supported by the emotional atmosphere that is built. The background music is not just a complement, but also a narrative element that strengthens the sense of scene. One of the most interesting things is the use of the song “Perayaan Mati Rasa” which is also the main theme. The music, created by Sal Priadi, is able to describe Ian’s feelings, with a melody that flows with deep lyrics adds to the melancholy impression and brings us even deeper into the inherent in Ian’s story. Ian’s lines, the dialogues that touch the heart, and the ending that is open to the audience, instead reinforces the message of survival, making this film leave a strong impression on the audience.
