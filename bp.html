        If you're looking for a Korean drama that's fun, light, and full of laughter, A Business Proposal could be the perfect choice! The drama is adapted from the novel The Office Blind Date by Hae Hwa, which was also successful as a webtoon. Directed by Park Seon Ho and produced by Kakao Entertainment and StudioS, the drama offers an office romance that is not only sweet but also spiced with fresh and entertaining comedy.

        The story follows Shin Ha Ri, an ordinary working woman who accidentally gets caught up in an absurd situation. Initially, she only intends to help her best friend Jin Young Seo by replacing her on a blind date. The plan was for Ha Ri to be annoying so that the man in front of her would immediately feel bad and reject the match. But who would have thought, the man she met was Kang Tae Mu, the CEO of the company where she works. Things get more complicated when Tae Mu, who is fed up with the blind dates arranged by his grandfather, decides to marry the first woman he meets,which in this case is Ha Ri who is pretending to be Young Seo!

        From here, the story unfolds with various funny and romantic situations. Ha Ri has to hide her true identity, while Tae Mu starts to feel something strange about the woman he's dating. Their relationship that started with a lie develops into something more serious, but of course with many hilarious moments along the way.

      What makes this drama interesting is the way it's executed, which feels fresh despite using classic tropes like fake dates, rich CEOs falling for ordinary employees, and best friends getting dragged into complicated relationships. The story is told in a light-hearted, less dramatic style, and there are surprises in every episode.​ One of the main attractions of A Business Proposal is of course the chemistry of the cast. Kim Se Jeong as Ha Ri manages to bring a cheerful, expressive, and lovable character. While Ahn Hyo Seop plays Tae Mu with the charisma of a cold CEO who slowly softens. Their interactions feel natural, both in comedic moments that make you laugh and during romantic scenes that successfully make you feel baper. Not to forget the couple Kim Min Gue and Seol In Ah, who play Young Seo and Sung Hoon. Many fell in love with their love story that felt more spontaneous and full of chemistry.

      In addition to the story and acting of the players, A Business Proposal also has a pacing that is easy to follow. There is no conflict that is too protracted or drama that is too heavy. With the right duration, each episode feels solid without any part that feels boring. Visually, the drama also presents a bright and colorful look, in keeping with its romantic comedy vibe. The slick cinematography and background music that support the atmosphere make the viewing experience even more enjoyable.​ If you need a show that can make your mood rise, A Business Proposal is the perfect choice. It has everything-a sweet love story, fresh humor, lovable characters, and a story that's not boring. It's perfect for those who love Korean rom-coms with fun and entertaining execution!
