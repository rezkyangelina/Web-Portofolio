        So, the story is about a girl named Pippa “Pip” Fitz-Amobi (played by Emma Myers) who is working on her school project. But instead of making a normal paper, she chooses the topic of a murder that happened five years ago in her town. The case is considered solved because everyone believes that Salil Singh, a teenage boy, killed his girlfriend, Andie Bell, and then committed suicide. But Pip isn't convinced. He starts investigating the case on his own and the further he digs, the more strange facts come to light. In fact, there are people who don't like his investigation and start threatening him. So, the question is, will Pip be able to prove the truth, or will he be in greater danger?

      One of the things that makes this series interesting is the way the story is built. From the very beginning, we're invited to join the puzzle with Pip. The mystery is not easy to guess, and every episode there is always a twist that makes us more curious. It feels like we're investigating the case ourselves!

      In addition, Pip's character is also the main attraction. He's not a professional detective, just a smart and curious teenager. But that's what makes him relatable. Pip is portrayed as a person who doesn't give up easily and has the courage to seek the truth, even though she has to deal with people who try to stop her. Emma Myers really succeeds in portraying Pip with the right energy and emotion. In terms of visuals, A Good Girl's Guide to Murder has great cinematography. The feel of a small town that's quiet but holds many secrets is palpable. There are many scenes that are built with lighting and background music that make the atmosphere even more tense. So, even though this is not a horror series, there are still moments that can make your heart pound.

      The series is also more than just a teen detective story. There are deeper themes raised, such as justice, prejudice, social pressure, and how someone can be scapegoated without strong evidence. Pip doesn't just try to solve the mystery, but also faces some pretty tough moral dilemmas. For those of you who like mystery stories with a fast-paced plot, full of surprises, and a smart main character, A Good Girl's Guide to Murder will definitely get you hooked. With only 6 episodes, this series doesn't take long to watch, but it's enough to keep you thinking and curious until the end. If you like Only Murders in the Building or Veronica Mars, chances are you'll love this one too. Just get ready for a marathon because each episode makes it hard to stop watching!
