      Have you ever imagined working as a passionate young prosecutor, but having to deal with a super perfectionist forensic expert? That's what Eun Sol experiences in the Korean drama “Partners for Justice”. The drama takes us through the world of forensics and prosecution in a way that is both thrilling and exciting.The story begins with Eun Sol (Jeong Yu Mi), a new prosecutor full of enthusiasm. She is assigned to handle her first case, the mysterious death of a woman found lifeless in her home. Unfortunately, Eun Sol's enthusiasm gets her into trouble when she unknowingly turns the victim's body over before the official examination is conducted. This brings her into conflict with Baek Beom (Jung Jae Young), a forensic expert who has a cold, gruff personality, but is a genius in his field.

      Since that first unpleasant meeting, Eun Sol must continue to work with Baek Beom in uncovering various mysterious death cases. Each episode of the drama presents different cases that are always related to forensics, ranging from death by poison, premeditated murder, to deaths that seem natural but have a mystery behind them. One of the main strengths of “Partners for Justice” is how each case is explored in great detail. The autopsy scene performed by Baek Beom is truly realistic. We are invited to see how the process of examining a corpse is carried out, from identifying wounds, analyzing the contents of the victim's stomach, to toxicology tests to detect the presence of toxic substances in the victim's body. Plus, there is Stella Hwang, a toxicologist who is deft and always helps in the investigation process.

      Not only the tension of solving cases, the drama also presents a touch of comedy and a little element of romance. Baek Beom, who is notoriously cold and difficult to approach, turns out to have a dark past that is slowly revealed throughout the drama. His personal life becomes one of the mysteries that make the audience more curious. Unfortunately, at the end of the episode, many major facts about his past are revealed quickly, making it feel a bit rushed. However, this paves the way for the continuation of the story in season 2. In addition to the thrilling storyline, “Partners for Justice” also presents excellent production quality. In terms of visuals, the detailed shot technique used in the autopsy scene makes us feel as if we are really witnessing the forensic process in the real world. Coupled with medical terms that are well explained through dialog and captions, this drama is not only entertaining, but also adds insight into the world of forensics and medicine.
