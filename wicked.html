      When looking at how massive the marketing campaign for Wicked is, there might be a slight concern, is the movie really as good as it promises to be? There are many movies that have amazing promotions but the end result is not comparable. Fortunately, Wicked manages to fulfill expectations by presenting stunning visuals and a touching story. From start to finish, the film brings the audience into a vibrant and colorful world of magic. Adapted from the novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West by Gregory Maguire and the Broadway musical Wicked, this movie invites us to see the story from a different perspective about the world of Oz. The focus is on two witches with contrasting backgrounds, Glinda (Ariana Grande), the glamorous and bubbly popular one, and Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), a talented witch who has to face stigma because of her green skin color. The two meet at Shiz University, going through a journey full of strife, friendship, and emotional moments that change their lives.

      The world of Oz in Wicked comes alive thanks to its colorful visuals. From the majestic Shiz University to the glittering Emerald City, everything is presented in stunning detail. Jon M. Chu, whose previous successes include Crazy Rich Asians, once again proves his expertise in creating visuals that are pleasing to the eye without being overwhelming. Colors such as green, which is synonymous with Elphaba, and pink, which symbolizes Glinda, further strengthen each character. As a musical movie, Wicked's main strength is certainly in its music. Songs like Defying Gravity, I'm Not That Girl, and What's This Feeling? remain a highlight, not just an interlude, but an important part of the story development. Each song fits the situation the characters are facing, deepening the emotions and enriching the dynamics of Glinda and Elphaba's relationship.

      Ariana Grande carries Glinda with a distinctive charm, reflecting a cheerful character who is a little spoiled but still lovable. Meanwhile, Cynthia Erivo truly shines as Elphaba. Her powerful and emotional voice makes every moment feel so profound. Their chemistry is very natural and is the core of this movie. Not only that, Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible looks so authoritative, Jeff Goldblum gives a charismatic impression as the Wizard of Oz, and Peter Dinklage as the voice of Dr. Dillamond adds depth to the story with his wise character. One of the highlights of Wicked is how it stays true to the original material. There are no major changes that risk losing the essence of the story, but rather an adaptation that feels right for the big screen. With captivating visuals, solid acting, and great music, the movie is an entertaining experience, especially for fans of musicals. However, for those unfamiliar with the genre, the long duration and the more song-driven plot and character development can feel a little slow.

      However, for those who love musicals or are interested in the story behind the world of Oz, Wicked offers a fun and emotional experience. This story of friendship, ambition, and sacrifice is not only visually beautiful, but also leaves a lasting impression. The film can be seen in theaters starting November 20, 2024, while the second part is scheduled for November 2025. For fans of The Wizard of Oz or Broadway, this is a must-see!
