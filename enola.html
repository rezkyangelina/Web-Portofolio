        The name Holmes is usually synonymous with Sherlock, the genius detective who is famous all over the world. But in the movie “Enola Holmes”, we are invited to get to know his equally intelligent and brave sister. Enola, played by Millie Bobby Brown, is a 16-year-old girl who grew up with an unusual upbringing. Her mother, Eudoria Holmes (Helena Bonham Carter), raised her to think critically, be brave and independent, a far cry from the standards of Victorian women.

        However, Enola's life takes a drastic turn when, on her 16th birthday, she discovers that her mother has disappeared without a trace. All she has left are clues in the form of flowery language cards and riddles to solve. Not wanting to be alone, Enola enlists the help of her two brothers, Sherlock (Henry Cavill) and Mycroft (Sam Claflin). Unfortunately, instead of helping, Mycroft wants to send her to a school of manners so that she becomes a “proper lady” according to the norms of the time. Unwilling to lose her freedom, Enola decides to run away from home and find her own mother. Disguised as a man, she leaves for London and embarks on a new adventure. On the way, she meets Lord Tewkesbury (Louis Partridge), a young nobleman who is also running away from his family. However, the situation is more complicated than she thought - there's a hitman after Tewkesbury, and his life is in real danger.

        Enola's adventure becomes even more thrilling. Aside from searching for her mother, she must also help Tewkesbury uncover the reason behind the assassination attempt on her. With her cleverness, she solves puzzles, faces threats, and even strategizes with Sherlock. Interestingly, throughout the movie Enola often speaks directly to the camera, as if inviting the audience to join her in her adventures. This technique, called fourth-wall breaking, makes us feel more connected to the characters and the story. Despite the many exciting and clever scenes, the movie leaves us with a few questions at the end. Where exactly did Eudoria Holmes go? What was her main purpose in leaving Enola? The answers given feel incomplete and hanging, as if opening up the possibility for the continuation of the story in the next movie. However, behind all the action and mystery, Enola Holmes conveys a strong message of independence and freedom. This movie teaches that women can also be smart, brave, and have control over their own lives.
    </p>
    <p>In terms of visuals, this movie captures the nuances of the Victorian era beautifully, from the costumes, the atmosphere of London, to the stunning artistic details. Millie Bobby Brown's acting also deserves a thumbs up, she manages to bring Enola's character into a smart, passionate, and energetic figure. Her chemistry with Henry Cavill as Sherlock is also one of the highlights. Overall, Enola Holmes is a fun watch, especially for mystery and adventure lovers. With an exciting story, strong characters, and an inspiring message, this movie should be on your watch list!</p>
