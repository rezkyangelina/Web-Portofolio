        Hi, series lovers! This time I want to talk about one of the series that was booming and is still widely talked about today, namely Wednesday. Yup, this series really managed to make many people fall in love, especially for those of you who like the horror comedy genre with a touch of mystery. The series aired on Netflix on November 23, 2022 and within two weeks, it was in the top four most-watched series in the world. Amazing, isn't it? With a total of 8 episodes, this series presents a combination of mystery, comedy, and horror that makes you curious from start to finish
      </p>
      <p>
        Produced by Miles Millar and Alfred Gough, Wednesday stars Jenna Ortega who manages to portray Wednesday Addams in a very iconic way. The story begins with Wednesday not accepting that her younger brother, Pugsley, is being bullied at school. Instead of reporting the teacher, she releases a piranha fish into the swimming pool while the bully is practicing. Can you imagine? As a result of his super brutal actions, Wednesday is sent to Nevermore Academy, a special school for children who are considered “different.” In her new school, she not only has to adjust to a unique environment, but also begins to uncover the mystery of a murder case related to her family.

      One of the main attractions of the series is the character of Wednesday, played brilliantly by Jenna Ortega. She really brings this character to life with her signature flat expression, sharp gaze, and sarcasm-filled dialogue that characterizes the Addams family. Her performance is very strong and gives a new nuance to this character, which has been quite iconic through various adaptations of The Addams Family. In terms of story, Wednesday offers an interesting mystery plot with a surprising twist. Although some elements feel familiar, especially with the “teen detective” format, the way it is executed keeps the story fresh. Viewers will be left wondering who the real culprit is behind the series of creepy events in Nevermore.

      The visuals in this series also deserve a thumbs up. The strong gothic atmosphere, cool cinematography, and mysterious atmosphere make Nevermore Academy feel alive. Every scene feels distinctive and supports the creepy yet stylish vibe attached to the Addams family. However, the series is not without its flaws. Some supporting characters feel underdeveloped, and some subplots feel like filler. In addition, those expecting a more horror and supernatural take on The Addams Family might be a little disappointed as Wednesday is more of a teen mystery with a touch of fantasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of visuals, this series is no joke. The strong gothic atmosphere, cool cinematography, and mysterious atmosphere bring Nevermore Academy to life. Jenna Ortega's acting is also top-notch! She brings Wednesday's cynical, intelligent, and curious character to life very convincingly. If you like mysteries wrapped in dark comedy and a bit of horror, Wednesday is definitely on your watch list. This series is perfect for enjoying alone or with family and friends. So, are you ready to investigate a mystery with Wednesday?
