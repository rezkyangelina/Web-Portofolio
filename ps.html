        Talking about Indonesian horror movies, it's incomplete without discussing Pengabdi Setan (2017), a remake of the 1980 classic that was a hit. In the hands of Joko Anwar, this version comes with a fresh feel but still maintains the classic vibe that gives you goosebumps. The story is still about the family of Rini (Tara Basro) who lives in an old house after her mother (Ayu Laksmi) has been seriously ill for years. But after her mother dies, strange events begin to emerge, a creepy figure that looks like her mother, mysterious noises in the house, and slowly Rini discovers terrible facts about her family's past that turned out to have an agreement with supernatural beings.

        Instead of just remaking it, Joko Anwar adds new elements that make the story more relevant for today's generation, and there's even a theory that the 2017 version is actually a prequel to the 1980 movie. Interesting, right? One of the things that makes Pengabdi Setan different from most horror movies is its gripping atmosphere from start to finish. It's not the jumpscare type of horror, but rather a sense of dread that is built slowly through dim lighting, silent sounds that are suddenly followed by scary music, and of course the apparitions that successfully give you goosebumps without having to scream too much.

      The old colonial house, which is spacious but feels cold and empty, makes the audience feel the tense atmosphere experienced by the characters. Moreover, the song “Kelam Malam”, which always appears at important moments, successfully adds to the tension and becomes one of the most iconic elements in this movie.

      In terms of acting, all the players appear solid. Tara Basro as Rini manages to bring the character of a strong but still humane sister. Adhiyat Abdulkhadir as Ian (the youngest child) also steals the show-despite the lack of dialog, his expression of fear feels natural. And of course, Ayu Laksmi who plays the mother. Although she doesn't have much screentime, her mysterious presence and cold expressions make your hair stand on end. Plus, the presence of Asmara Abigail who appears at the end of the movie and immediately triggers various theories from the audience. From a technical point of view, this movie is a winner. Cinematography by Ical Tanjung makes every scene feel alive from the gloomy old house to the scenes in the cemetery that give goosebumps. The sound and music are also taken seriously, creating a more immersive horror experience. The sudden silence followed by faint noises further reinforces the spooky feel.

      Besides being scary, Pengabdi Setan also has an interesting depth of story. The movie touches on themes of family, sacrifice, and how the legacy of the past can impact the next generation. There are also elements of social criticism implied, especially about beliefs and fanaticism that can lead someone down a terrible path. Joko Anwar has successfully crafted a horror that is not only scary, but also has a deep message. No wonder Pengabdi Setan is one of the best-selling Indonesian horror films of all time. This film successfully creates a memorable horror experience with a gripping atmosphere, strong acting, and mature storytelling. For those who like horror with a strong story, this movie is definitely a must-watch. But get ready, after watching this movie, you might find yourself looking into the dark corners of your own home more often.
